Problem #5. We have seen that we can fit an SVM with a non-linear kernel in order to perform classification using a non-linear decision boundary. We will now see that we can also obtain a non-linear decision boundary by performing logistic regression using non-linear transformations of the features.

(a) Generate a data set with n = 500 and p = 2, such that the observations belong to two classes with a quadratic decision boundary between them. For instance, you can do this as follows:

> x1=runif (500) -0.5

> x2=runif (500) -0.5

> y=1*(x1^2-x2^2 > 0)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x1=runif(500) -0.5
x2=runif(500) -0.5 
y=1*(x1^2-x2^2 > 0)
```

(b) Plot the observations, colored according to their class labels. Your plot should display 𝑋1 on the x-axis, and 𝑋2 on the y-axis.

```{r}
colors=ifelse(y==0, 'red', 'blue')
plot(x1, x2, col=colors)
```
(c) Fit a logistic regression model to the data, using 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 as predictors.

```{r}

data1 = data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2, y = as.factor(y))
lm.fit = glm(y ~ x1 + x2, family = binomial)
summary(lm.fit)
```
(d) Apply this model to the training data in order to obtain a predicted class label for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels. The decision boundary should be linear.

```{r}
lm.prob = predict(lm.fit, data1, type = "response")
lm.pred = ifelse(lm.prob > 0.5, 1, 0)
colors = ifelse(lm.pred==0, 'red', 'blue')
plot(x1, x2, col = colors)
```
(e) Now fit a logistic regression model to the data using non-linear functions of 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 as predictors (e.g. 𝑋21, 𝑋1× 𝑋2, log(𝑋2), and so forth).

```{r}
lm.fit2 = glm(y~poly(x1,2)+poly(x2,2), data = data1, family = "binomial")
```

(f) Apply this model to the training data in order to obtain a predicted class label for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels. The decision boundary should be obviously non-linear. If it is not, then repeat (a)-(e) until you come up with an example in which the predicted class labels are obviously non-linear.
```{r}
lm.prob2 = predict(lm.fit2, data1, type = "response")
lm.pred2 = ifelse(lm.prob2 > 0.5, 1, 0)
colors = ifelse(lm.pred2==0, 'red', 'blue')
plot(x1, x2, col = colors)
```
(g) Fit a support vector classifier to the data with 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 as predictors. Obtain a class prediction for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels.


```{r}
library(e1071)
data = data.frame(x=cbind(x1,x2),y=as.factor(y))
set.seed(1)
tune.out = tune(svm,y~.,data=data,kernal="linear",ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100)), scale = FALSE)
summary(tune.out)
bestmod = tune.out$best.model
summary(bestmod)
plot(bestmod,data)
```
(h) Fit a SVM using a non-linear kernel to the data. Obtain a class prediction for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels.

```{r}
lm.prob2 = predict(lm.fit2, data1, type = "response")
lm.pred2 = ifelse(lm.prob2 > 0.5, 1, 0)
colors = ifelse(lm.pred2==0, 'red', 'blue')
plot(x1, x2, col = colors)
```

```{r}
tune.out = tune(svm,y~.,data=data,kernal="radial",ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100)), scale = FALSE)
ypred1 = predict(tune.out$best.model, data)
summary(tune.out)
bestmod = tune.out$best.model
summary(bestmod)
plot(bestmod,data)
```
